- Backend: Python (puzzle generation/validation), Supabase (database)
- APIs: OpenAI GPT-4, SearchAPI

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.8+
- Supabase account
- OpenAI API key
- SearchAPI key

## Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nba-connections.git
cd nba-connections
```

2. Create `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
SEARCHAPI_API_KEY=your_searchapi_key
```

3. Create `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the same variables.

## Database Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Run the SQL scripts from `backend/schemas/`:
```sql

```bash
npm install
```

2. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
