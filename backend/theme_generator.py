NBA Connections is a word game that challenges users to find themes between NBA players. Users are given 16 players and find groups of four items that share something in common.

For example:
1. Los Angeles Lakers Franchise Leaders: Kobe Bryant, Elgin Baylor, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
2. Top 4 Picks from the 1996 NBA Draft: Allen Iverson, Marcus Camby, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Stephon Marbury

Each group is assigned a color (Yellow, Green, Blue, or Purple), with Yellow being the easiest category and Purple being the trickiest.

Each puzzle has exactly one solution and is meant to be tricky by having players that could fit into multiple categories.

</context>

<requirements>
Your task is to come up with {n} unique themes for the {color_name} category. Each theme should have exactly 4 distinct NBA Player Names.

Requirements:

1. Each theme must be unique and not overlap with other themes.
2. The players in each theme must be distinct and fit the theme accurately.
3. All player names should be recognizable and use their full names (no nicknames).
4. Make sure there are 4 players in each theme.
5. The themes should be appropriate for the {color_name} category, which is considered {color_description}.

The final output should be a JSON array of themes, like:

[
    {{
        "color": "{color_code}",
        "emoji": "{emoji}",
        "theme": "Describe the theme here",
        "words": ["PLAYER ONE", "PLAYER TWO", "PLAYER THREE", "PLAYER FOUR"]
    }},
    ...
]
